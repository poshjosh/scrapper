If you change any table, column names etc here then you have
to rework the persistence layer
Change sitename.timecreated and sitename.datemodified
Change siteurl.sitename_sitenameid to siteurl.sitenameid
Change columns state in all tables
Move db2 to db1
change sitename.datemodified to .timemodified
Is there anything wrong with varchar 10000 if so change
url here should not be unique as content may change for same url every day
